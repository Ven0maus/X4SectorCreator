You should start with creating a new cluster using the "New" button under the cluster section.
This will also automatically create a sector with the same name, this can be edited by doubleclicking on the new sector entry.
You can now create a connection between this new sector and another sector by selecting the source sector and pressing "New" button under the connections section.
This will prompt you with a screen where you can select the target sector and set the gate position and rotation.
You can left click within the hexagons to move the gate around, and right click to rotate the gate.
After your connection is added you can press Generate XML and it will prompt you with a screen to enter the name of your mod and the prefix you would like to use.
